# Addy App — Status & Context Handoff

## What This Project Is
**Addy** is a free web app for business owners — a financial clarity tool with
three goal tracks: **Cash flow**, **Grow revenue**, and **Exit/Sell**. The UI is
a conversational, chat-style flow ("FREE VERSION" ribbon, ADDY by Addvantage
Advisory Services branding). It has a companion Framer landing page and is used
for user testing / investor demos.

## Architecture
Frontend and business logic are split so the calculation IP isn't publicly readable:

| Layer | Service | URL |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Frontend (UI) | GitHub Pages | https://addyaddvantage.github.io/addy-app/ |
| Business logic (IP) | Cloudflare Worker | https://addy-calculator.michelle-1db.workers.dev |
| Landing page | Framer | https://www.addvantage.ca/addy |

- **Repo:** https://github.com/AddyAddvantage/addy-app (branch `main`, auto-deploys to Pages in ~1 min on push)
- **Accounts:** GitHub `AddyAddvantage` · Cloudflare + Framer under michelle@addvantage.ca

```
Script load order in index.html: `logic.js` → `analytics.js` → `app.js`

## Cloudflare Worker — API Contract (current `worker.js`)
`POST https://addy-calculator.michelle-1db.workers.dev`
Body: `{ goal: 'cash'|'grow'|'exit', inputs: {...} }` → returns `{ result: {...} }`

- **cash** in `{rev, dso, tgt}` → out `{trapped, freed, tgt, tgtLessThanDso, danger}`
  - dso=0 is treated as a real choice = "Due on Receipt", not a missing value
- **grow** in `{c, p, pi, ni}` → out `{cur, nw, gp, gc, gt, lo}`
- **exit** in `{profit, years, dep, pi, di, nothingSelected}` → out `{curVal, newVal, uplift, isDanger, currentMult, newMult, profitNew, checks, nothingSelected}`
  - di = -1 means nothing selected yet; diBonus array `[0.1, 0.5, 1.5]`

### ⚠️ Worker deployment notes
- **CORS is currently wildcard (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)** — open to any
  origin. Convenient now; tighten to specific domains before public launch.
- **The repo `worker.js` is the source of truth.** If you edit calculations, you
  MUST paste it into the Cloudflare dashboard (Workers & Pages → addy-calculator)
  and click Deploy. Pushing to GitHub does NOT update the Worker.

App-side call pattern (`app.js`): `WORKER_URL` constant → `async function api(goal, inputs)` → `await api('cash'|'grow'|'exit', {...})`.

## ✅ Done
- New HTML migrated (from `addy-full (5).html`) with updated styling + corrected calculations
- v2 conversational chat UI: chips, input summaries, red cash box
- v3 styling foundation restored across all tabs
- v4 conversational flows across all three tracks
- Payment-terms dropdown restored: **Due on Receipt / Net 30 / 60 / 90**
- Fixed duplicate actions card on Grow tab
- CTA box aligned with chat cards on Grow + Exit
- Calculations corrected and matched between `app.js` inputs and `worker.js` logic
  (incl. dso=0 and exit "nothing selected" edge cases)
- Addy mascot circle resolved — 304px circle, `overflow:hidden`, inset sage-dark
  ring (`box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 8px`), video at 81% width, responsive down to 128px
- Logic kept server-side; `logic.js` holds only the display formatter
- Design tokens expanded (added `--line`, `--muted`)

## 🔧 Still Open / Not Done
- **Analytics IDs are placeholders** — `GA_ID = 'G-XXXXXXXXXX'` and
  `CLARITY_ID = 'XXXXXXXXXX'` need real values (these are client-side IDs, safe to commit)
- **Worker CORS** still wildcard `*` — lock down before launch
- **Framer landing-page CTAs** — confirm they point to the live app URL (not `#`)
- **Tally.so email gate** — planned, not built (name + email before app access)

## Working Preferences
- **Copy:** Ogilvy-direct meets Don Draper — punchy, benefit-led, no wasted words
- **Design:** Apple-sleek, generous whitespace; sage/forest greens + gold/stone
- **Process:** discuss/align before pushing to production; budget-conscious (free/low-cost tools)
- **Deploy:** `git add . && git commit && git push origin main` for the app;
  **separately** paste `worker.js` into the Cloudflare dashboard for any logic change
